# ---- SCREENING FOR CARELESS RESPONDING ----

# Ensure no missing data in the key response variable CSS_B_1
df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(CSS_B_1))

# 1. Longstring Index:
# The Longstring index measures the longest sequence of identical responses
# a participant gives in a survey (e.g., answering "3" repeatedly across items).
# Strengths: Helps detect inattentiveness, especially if participants are responding lazily.
# Weaknesses: May flag participants who are consistent but attentive in their responses.
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    longstring = longstring(dplyr::select(df, CSS_B_1:CSS_B_18)),  # Longest streak of identical responses
    avgstring = longstring(dplyr::select(df, CSS_B_1:CSS_B_18), avg = TRUE)  # Average length of identical responses
  )

# 2. Intra-Individual Response Variability (IRV):
# IRV calculates how variable a participant's responses are across items.
# High IRV indicates fluctuating responses, while low IRV suggests consistency.
# Strengths: Useful for detecting erratic or inconsistent behavior within a single survey.
# Weaknesses: Participants with genuinely varied opinions may be falsely flagged.
df <- df %>%
  mutate(irv = irv(dplyr::select(df, CSS_B_1:CSS_B_18)))  # Measures variability across responses

# 3. Mahalanobis Distance:
# Mahalanobis distance measures the distance of a participant’s response profile 
# from the overall sample’s response mean, considering multiple variables.
# Strengths: Detects multivariate outliers who deviate significantly from the group.
# Weaknesses: May flag legitimate responses if the participant is genuinely different from the sample.
response_items <- dplyr::select(df, CSS_B_1:CSS_B_18)
df <- df %>%
  mutate(mahalanobis_distance = mahalanobis(response_items, 
                                            colMeans(response_items, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                            cov(response_items, use = "complete.obs")))

# 4. Person-Total Correlation (PTC):
# The Person-Total Correlation measures how closely each item in a survey 
# correlates with the participant’s total score across all items, excluding that item.
# Strengths: Identifies responses that are inconsistent with the participant’s overall pattern.
# Weaknesses: Can flag low variability respondents, even if they are consistent and attentive.
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    total_score = rowSums(across(starts_with("CSS_B_")), na.rm = TRUE)  # Total score across all CSS_B_ items
  )

df <- df %>%

    person_total_corr = {
      # Extract the current row's response vector for CSS_B_ items
      response_vector <- c_across(starts_with("CSS_B_"))
      
      # Calculate the leave-one-out total score (excluding each item from the total)
      leave_one_out_total <- total_score - response_vector
      
      # Only calculate correlation if there's variability in both vectors
      if (length(unique(response_vector[!is.na(response_vector)])) > 1 &&
          length(unique(leave_one_out_total[!is.na(leave_one_out_total)])) > 1) {
        cor(response_vector, leave_one_out_total, use = "complete.obs")
      } else {
